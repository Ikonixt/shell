<b>Milestone 7: Tic-Tac-Toe</b><br />
You can play a simple tic-tac-toe against the computer by typing the command "ttt" into the shell (without the quotations). However, please only enter 1-9 and no other characters or the shell will bug out.<br />
<br />
<b>Known bugs that I can not solve:</b><br />
#1 Sometimes icsh prints out twice. I do not know why that happens, but it causes no issues.<br />
#2 printf sometimes output into the input, I do not know of any ways to solve this.<br />

<b>On references</b><br />
I definitely used a whole lot of stackoverflow searches which I don't remember exactly which pages because I browsed through so much, but I never copied any code, I coded everything by myself and I can definitely explain what every line does (99%). I did heavily referenced from tutorialpoint and a stackoverflow page that I forgot on how to tokenize strings https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strtok.htm. Aside from that, I used calloc because Pornkamol told me that it's safer than malloc. Most of the things such as WIF signal handling comes from pages like https://linux.die.net/man/2/waitpid. Other than that, Ajarn Sunsern helped me with waitpid, and background/foreground handling.
