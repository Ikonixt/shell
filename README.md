<b>Milestone 7: Tic-Tac-Toe</b><br />
You can play a simple tic-tac-toe against the computer by typing the command "ttt" into the shell (without the quotations). However, please only enter 1-9 and no other characters or the shell will bug out.<br />
<br />
<b>Known bugs that I can not solve:</b><br />
#1 Sometimes icsh prints out twice. I do not know why that happens, but it causes no issues.<br />
#2 printf sometimes output into the input, I do not know of any ways to solve this.<br />
